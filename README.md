# Project Title: Telecommunication Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a telecommunications company and building a Logistic Regression prediction model to predict customer churn and retention.

## Project Description

This project uses a fictional telecommunications company dataset, containing data on 7043 customers with various attributes such as tenure, contract type, services, payment method, dependents status, etc. The data reveals that 5174 customers chose retention, while 1869 chose to churn, which constitutes 26.5% of the total.

The relatively high churn rate raises the following objectives:
- How to increase customer retention rates?
- What variables have the greatest influence on Telecommunication Customer Churn?
- Can we build a customer churn probability prediction model to reduce churn rates?

## Directory Structure

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed all required dependencies. You can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

To run the **Telecommunication Customer Churn Analysis** project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/m1racle31/Telecommunication-Customer-Churn-Analysis
cd Telecommunication-Customer-Churn-Analysis
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure all required dependencies are installed. This project uses Python, and the dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare the Dataset
Make sure the dataset is located in the `data/` folder. If the dataset is not available in the repository, download the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset and place it inside the `data/` directory.

### 4. Run the Preprocessing and Model Evaluation

You can execute the main script to load the data, preprocess it, load the trained model, and evaluate its performance. Simply run the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This script will:
- Load the data from the `data/` folder.
- Preprocess the data, applying transformations to both numerical and categorical variables.
- Load the pre-trained Logistic Regression model from `results/model/`.
- Make predictions on the test data.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by calculating accuracy, generating the confusion matrix, and displaying the classification report.

### 5. Additional Exploration with Notebooks (Optional)
If you want to explore the data or run specific analyses interactively, you can use the Jupyter Notebooks provided in the `notebooks/` folder.

To launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open any `.ipynb` files from the `notebooks/` directory for further exploration or analysis.

### 6. Output and Recommendations
Once the script completes:
- Model evaluation outputs such as the confusion matrix and classification report will be displayed.
- The trained model will be saved in the results/model/ folder when running the prediction_model.py file.
- You can create and save the recommendations for improving customer retention based on the churn analysis in `results/recommendation/`
